Overview
--------
Syngine service client for ObsPy.

Contains requests abilities that naturally integrate with the rest of ObsPy
for the IRIS syngine service (https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/syngine/).

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
